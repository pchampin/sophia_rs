//! An RDF dataset is composed of a default graph,
//! and zero or more named graphs, each associated with a graph name.
//!
//! Another way to look at it is as a collection of [quads](../quad/index.html).
//!
//! This module provides [reusable abstractions](#traits)
//! for different kinds of datasets,
//! as well as a few implementations for them.
