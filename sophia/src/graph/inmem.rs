//! In-memory implementations of RDF graphs.
//!
//! This module provides [building blocks](#structs)
//! for defining implementations of [`Graph`] and [`MutableGraph`],
//! with fine-tuned trade-offs between memory footprint and performance.
//!
//! It also provides two pre-defined trade-offs:
//! [`FastGraph`] and [`LightGraph`],
//! provided in different flavors
//! ([default](#types), [`small`](small/index.html), [`sync`](sync/index.html)).
//!
//! # Customized trade-off
//!
//! By combining a given core implementation with various wrappers,
//! you can easily make a Graph type with the exact trade-offs that you need.
//!
//! For example, if one needs a small graph (less than 2^16 terms),
//! that can be exchanged across threads,
//! and whose arcs will mostly be traversed backward (from object to subject),
//! an appropriate type definition would be:
//!
//! ```
//! use sophia::term::factory::ArcTermFactory;
//! use sophia::graph::inmem::*;
//!
//! type MyGraph = OpsWrapper<GenericGraph<u16, ArcTermFactory>>;
//! let g = MyGraph::new();
//! ```
//!

//! [`MutableGraph`]: ../trait.MutableGraph.html
//! [`FastGraph`]: type.FastGraph.html
//! [`LightGraph`]: type.LightGraph.html
